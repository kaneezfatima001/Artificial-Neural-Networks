    "## What is fraud detection ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Fraud detection is the process of identifying and preventing unauthorized activity in organizations. It has become a major challenge for companies in industries such as banking, finance, retail, and e-commerce. Fraud can negatively impact an organization's financial performance and reputation, making it crucial for companies to prevent and predict suspicious activity.\n"

    "## Complex and evolving fraud patterns \n",
    "\n",
    "Fraudsters continually revise their strategies and devise ever-more-sophisticated methods to cheat the system, regularly involving intricate networks of transactions to prevent recognition. Traditional rule-based systems and matrix-based ML such as SVMs and XGBoost often just ponder the immediate edges of a deal (who transferred money to whom), usually omitting to notice fraudulent patterns with more complicated context. Rule-based systems furthermore need to be manually adjusted as fraud patterns shift and new scams arise.\n"

    "## Label Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets for fraud detection are commonly unbalanced and incompletely labeled. In reality, only a tiny fraction of people plan to perpetrate fraud. Usually, domain specialists will label transactions as fraudulent or not, but they can't make certain that all fraud has been identified in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The large disparity between the number of labels and the amount of data available renders it hard to generate supervised models. Models trained on the accessible classifications could have a greater number of false negatives, while the imbalanced dataset could lead to an increase in false positives. Consequently, training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with different objectives and making use of their latent representations afterwards can be advantageous.\n"

    "\n",
    "Predicting if a transaction is fraudulent or not is inadequate for meeting the transparency standards of the banking sector. It is also essential to comprehend why certain deals are marked as deceitful. This explicability is critical for comprehending how fraud occurs, how to execute procedures to reduce fraud, and to make sure the process isn’t prejudiced. As a result, fraud detection models must be comprehensible and interpretable, which restricts the choices of models that investigators can apply."

    "## Graph approaches for fraud detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Transactions can be represented as a graph, with users as nodes and interactions between them as edges. Traditional feature-based algorithms such as XGBoost and DLRM analyze individual nodes or edges, while graph-based approaches take into account the local context and structure of the graph, including neighboring nodes and edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the traditional graph domain, there are various methods for making predictions based on graph structure, such as statistical approaches that aggregate features from adjacent nodes or edges. Algorithms like the [Louvain method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvain_method) and [InfoMap](https://towardsdatascience.com/infomap-algorithm-9b68b7e8b86) can identify communities and clusters of users on the graph. However, these methods lack the expressivity to fully consider the graph in its original format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph neural networks (GNNs) offer a solution by representing local structural and feature context natively within the model. Through aggregation and message passing, information from both edges and nodes is propagated to neighboring nodes. Multiple layers of graph convolution result in a node's state containing information from nodes multiple layers away, effectively allowing the GNN to have a \"receptive field\" of nodes or edges multiple jumps away from the node or edge in question.\n",
    "\n",
    "For fraud detection, GNNs can account for complex or longer chains of transactions that fraudsters use for obfuscation. Additionally, changing patterns can be addressed by retraining the model iteratively."

    "These are the general steps of ML on Graph, depending on the task, the methods used in each step may change and not all the steps may be needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Graph Representation: The first step in applying machine learning techniques to graphs is to represent the graph in a format that can be input into a machine learning model. This can be done using various graph representations such as adjacency matrices, adjacency lists, and edge lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Feature Extraction: Once the graph is represented, the next step is to extract features from the graph that can be used as input to a machine learning model. These features can include things like node degree, centrality measures, and graph traversal patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Dimensionality Reduction: As the number of nodes and edges in a graph can be large, it is often necessary to reduce the dimensionality of the graph representation before applying machine learning techniques. This can be done using techniques like principal component analysis (PCA) and t-SNE.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Model Selection: After the graph is represented and features have been extracted, the next step is to select a machine learning model that can be applied to the graph data. Common models used for graph data include decision trees, random forests, and neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Training and Evaluation: Once the model is selected, it is trained on the graph data using a labeled training dataset. The model is then evaluated on a separate test dataset to assess its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Predictions: After the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new graph data. For example, it can be used to predict the likelihood of a node in a graph being in a certain class or to predict the likelihood of a link between two nodes."

    "## Dataset \n",
    "The IBM credit card transaction dataset is a publicly available dataset that contains information about credit card transactions. It is often used for research and testing of fraud detection models. The dataset includes a variety of features such as the amount of the transaction, the type of card used, and the location of the transaction. It also includes a label indicating whether or not the transaction was fraudulent. The dataset is designed to be representative of real-world transactions and therefore contains a certain level of class imbalance, with a higher number of non-fraudulent transactions than fraudulent transactions. The dataset is provided by IBM and the data is simulated, but it is not specified the exact process of data simulation. It is important to note that the data is not real and it is not linked to any real customer or financial institution.\n",

    "The data set contains: \n",
    "* 24 million unique transactions\n",
    "* 6,000 unique merchants\n",

    "\n",
    "Preprocessing tabular data before creating a graph is important because it ensures that the data is in a format that can be easily converted into a graph structure. Tabular data, such as a CSV file, typically contains rows and columns of information, with each row representing a single record and each column representing a specific feature or attribute. Before creating a graph, it is essential to clean and transform the data so that it is consistent and in a format that can be easily mapped to a graph structure. This may include tasks such as filling in missing values, converting data types, and removing duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, preprocessing tabular data can also help to improve the performance and accuracy of graph-based algorithms by reducing noise and irrelevant information in the data. This can be achieved by removing irrelevant features, normalizing numerical data, and encoding categorical data. Preprocessing can also help to balance the class distribution in case of imbalanced data, which is a common problem in fraud detection datasets.\n",

    "## GNN for fraud detection:\n",
    "Creating a multigraph for fraud detection using transaction data and applying a Graph Neural Network (GNN) on the edge list can be done in the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prepare the transaction data: Collect and organize the transaction data into a format that can be used to create the edges of the multigraph. For example, each transaction could be represented as a tuple (node1, node2, attributes), where node1 and node2 represent the sender and receiver of the transaction, and attributes is a dictionary containing properties such as the amount, timestamp, and transaction type.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create the multigraph: Use the transaction data to create a multigraph using the NetworkX library. The add_edge() method can be used to add edges to the multigraph, where each edge represents a transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Extract the edges list and their features: Use the edges() method of the multigraph to extract the edges list and their features, which will be used as input to the GNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Apply a GNN on the edge list: Use a GNN library such as PyTorch Geometric, Deep Graph Library (DGL) or Spektral to apply a GNN on the edge list. The GNN will learn representations of the edges in the multigraph and use them to classify the edges as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Evaluation: To evaluate the performance of the GNN, you can split the data into train and test sets, and use the test set to evaluate the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the model."

    "### Graph construction \n",
    "\n",
    "When constructing a graph with transaction edges between card_id and merchant_name, the first step is to identify the nodes in the graph. In this case, the card_id and merchant_name represent the nodes in the graph. Each card_id represents a unique credit card and each merchant_name represents a unique merchant. These nodes can be created by extracting the card_id and merchant_name information from the tabular data and storing them in separate lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the nodes have been identified, the next step is to create edges between them. These edges represent the transactions that have taken place between a card_id and a merchant_name. To create the edges, a list of transactions is created and for each transaction, an edge is created between the card_id and merchant_name.\n"

    "The forward function of the model applies the linear layers to the input tensor \"x\" and applies a ReLU activation function to the output of the first linear layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also prepare data for input into the model. We define the variable \"edge_list\" which is a list of edges and their associated data in a graph G. Then we create an empty list called \"x\" and iterates over each edge in the edge_list. For each edge, it extracts the values of the edge data, converts them to floats if needed, and append them to the list \"x\". Finally, we convert the list \"x\" to a PyTorch tensor with float datatype, which is ready to be input into the FraudGNN model."

    "In this part we will base our work on the [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0957417421017449) **Inductive Graph Representation Learning for fraud detection** written by RafaëlVan Belle, Charles Van Damme, Hendrik Tytgat and JochenDe Weerdt. \n",
    "\n",
    "Charles has created a python library with the name of inductiveGRL for the experimental setup of their paper. \n",
    "\n",
    "Library overview :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Transaction Data\n",
    "Any dataset that can be transformed into a graph can be used in our experimental setup. For our research, we used a real-life dataset to construct credit card transaction networks containing millions of transactions. This dataset includes information on the following features: anonymized identification of clients and merchants, merchant category code, country, monetary amount, time, acceptance, and fraud label. This real-life dataset is highly imbalanced and contains only 0.65% fraudulent transactions. Note that the demo data in this repository is artificaly generated for demonstration purposes. The Timeframes component derives the different timeframes for a rolling window setup given a step and window size.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Graph Construction\n",
    "The GraphConstruction component constructs the graphs that will be used by graph representation learners (e.g. FI-GRL and GraphSAGE) to learn node embeddings. We designed the credit card transaction networks as heterogeneous tripartite graphs containing client, merchant and transaction nodes. Because of this tripartite setup, representations can be learned for the transaction nodes. Only the transaction nodes are configured with node features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. GraphSAGE\n",
    "The HinSAGE code deploys a supervised, heterogeneous implementation of the GraphSAGE framework called HinSAGE, to learn embeddings of the transaction nodes in the aforementioned graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. FI-GRL\n",
    "The FIGRL code learns embeddings of the transaction nodes in the aforementioned graphs using the Fast Inductive Graph Representation Learning Framework. We call the Matlab implementation of FI-GRL from our Jupyter notebooks, which requires an appropriate installation of matlab.engine in the same folder as the notebooks. If you wish to run FI-GRL from Python, please run the following command in Matlab:\n",
    "\n",
    "cd (fullfile(matlabroot,'extern','engines','python'))\n",
    "system('python setup.py install')\n",
    "\n",
    "This will generate a folder in matlabroot\\extern\\engines\\python\\build\\lib called 'matlab' please copy this folder and place it on the same location as the notebook from which you want to call matlab.engine. If you don't know your matlab root, running 'matlabroot' in Matlab will return the appropriate path.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Classifier\n",
    "The penultimate component in our pipeline uses the transaction node embeddings to classify the transaction nodes as fraudulent or legitimate. We chose to rely on XGBoost as a classification model, but other classifiers can easily be implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Evaluation\n",
    "The Evaluation component contains functions for the Lift score, Lift curve and precision-recall curve. We focused on these evaluation metrics given the highly imbalanced nature of our dataset. However, this code can easily be extended to contain other evaluation metrics such as ROC plots."
